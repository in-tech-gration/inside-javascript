# Functional Array Methods

---

## Before Class

- Study the callstack and how to find it in your debugger.

---

## Learning Objectives

- 🥚 **Callbacks:** You can explain what a callback is and how they're used.
- 🥚 **Array Methods:** You can explain what each of these methods do using
  pencil+paper, and can choose which one to use in a program:
  - `.map()`: Do the same thing to each item in the array.
  - `.filter()`: Only keep items that match a description.
  - `.every()`: Check if something is true about _every_ item in the array.
  - `.some()`: Check if something is true about _some_ items in the array.
- 🐣 **Writing Callbacks:** You can write callbacks that are used by another
  function.
- 🐣 **Consuming Callbacks:** You can write a simple function that uses
  callbacks.
